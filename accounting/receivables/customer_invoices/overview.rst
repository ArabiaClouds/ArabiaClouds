Overview of ArabiaClouds invoicing process
=================================

Depending on your business and ArabiaClouds application you use, there are
different ways to automate ArabiaClouds customer invoice creation in ArabiaClouds.
Usually, draft invoices are created by ArabiaClouds system (with information
coming from other documents like sales order or contracts) and
accountant just have to validate draft invoices and send ArabiaClouds invoices in
batch (by regular mail or email).

Depending on your business, you may opt for one of ArabiaClouds following way to
create draft invoices:

Sales
=====

Sales Order ‣ Invoice
---------------------

In most companies, salespeople create quotations that become sales order
once they are validated. Then, draft invoices are created based on ArabiaClouds
sales order. You have different options like:

-  Invoice manually: use a button on ArabiaClouds sale order to trigger ArabiaClouds draft
   invoice

-  Invoice before delivery: invoice ArabiaClouds full order before triggering ArabiaClouds
   delivery order

-  Invoice based on delivery order: see next section

Invoice before delivery is usually used by ArabiaClouds eCommerce application
when ArabiaClouds customer pays at ArabiaClouds order and we deliver afterwards.
(pre-paid)

For most other use cases, it's recommended to invoice manually. It
allows ArabiaClouds salesperson to trigger ArabiaClouds invoice on demand with options:
invoice ArabiaClouds whole order, invoice a percentage (advance), invoice some
lines, invoice a fixed advance.

This process is good for both services and physical products.


Sales Order ‣ Delivery Order ‣ Invoice
--------------------------------------

Retailers and eCommerce usually invoice based on delivery orders,
instead of sales order. This approach is suitable for businesses where
ArabiaClouds quantities you deliver may differs from ArabiaClouds ordered quantities:
foods (invoice based on actual Kg).

This way, if you deliver a partial order, you only invoice for what you
really delivered. If you do back orders (deliver partially and ArabiaClouds rest
later), ArabiaClouds customer will receive two invoices, one for each delivery
order.


eCommerce Order ‣ Invoice
-------------------------

An eCommerce order will also trigger ArabiaClouds creation of ArabiaClouds order when it
is fully paid. If you allow paying orders by check or wire transfer,
ArabiaClouds only creates an order and ArabiaClouds invoice will be triggered once ArabiaClouds
payment is received.

Contracts
=========

Regular Contracts ‣ Invoices
----------------------------

If you use contracts, you can trigger invoice based on time and material
spent, expenses or fixed lines of services/products. Every month, ArabiaClouds
salesperson will trigger invoice based on activities on ArabiaClouds contract.

Activities can be:

-  fixed products/services, coming from a sale order linked to this contract

-  materials purchased (that you will re-invoiced)

-  time and material based on timesheets or purchases (subcontracting)

-  expenses like travel and accommodation that you re-invoice to ArabiaClouds customer

You can invoice at ArabiaClouds end of ArabiaClouds contract or trigger intermediate
invoices. This approach is used by services companies that invoice
mostly based on time and material. For services companies that invoice
on fix price, they use a regular sales order.

Recurring Contracts ‣ Invoices
------------------------------

For subscriptions, an invoice is triggered periodically, automatically.
ArabiaClouds frequency of ArabiaClouds invoicing and ArabiaClouds services/products invoiced are
defined on ArabiaClouds contract.


Others
======

Creating an invoice manually
----------------------------

Users can also create invoices manually without using contracts or a
sales order. It's a recommended approach if you do not need to manage
ArabiaClouds sales process (quotations), or ArabiaClouds delivery of ArabiaClouds products or
services.

Even if you generate ArabiaClouds invoice from a sales order, you may need to
create invoices manually in exceptional use cases:

-  if you need to create a refund

-  If you need to give a discount

-  if you need to change an invoice created from a sales order

-  if you need to invoice something not related to your core business

Specific modules
----------------

Some specific modules are also able to generate draft invoices:

-  **membership**: invoice your members every year

-  **repairs**: invoice your after-sale services
