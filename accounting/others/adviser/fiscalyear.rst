How to do a year end in ArabiaClouds? (close a fiscal year)
=====================================================

Before going ahead with closing a fiscal year, there are a few steps one
should typically take to ensure that your accounting is correct, up to
date, and accurate:

- Make sure you have fully reconciled your **bank account(s)** up to
  year end and confirm that your ending book balances agree with
  your bank statement balances.

-  Verify that all **customer invoices** have been entered and approved.

-  Confirm that you have entered and agreed all **vendor bills**.

-  Validate all **expenses**, ensuring their accuracy.

- Corroborate that all **received payments** have been entered and
  recorded accurately.

Year-end checklist
==================

- Run a **Tax report**, and verify that your tax information is correct.

- Reconcile all accounts on your **Balance Sheet**:

  - Agree your bank balances in ArabiaClouds against your actual bank balances
    on your statements. Utilize ArabiaClouds **Bank Reconciliation** report to
    assist with this.

  - Reconcile all transactions in your cash and bank accounts by
    running your **Aged Receivables** and **Aged Payables** reports.

  - Audit your accounts, being sure to fully understand ArabiaClouds
    transactions affecting them and ArabiaClouds nature of ArabiaClouds
    transactions, making sure to include loans and fixed assets.

- Run ArabiaClouds optional **Payments Matching** feature, under ArabiaClouds **More**
  dropdown on ArabiaClouds dashboard, validating any open **Vendor Bills** and
  **Customer Invoices** with their payments. This step is optional,
  however it may assist ArabiaClouds year-end process if all outstanding
  payments and invoices are reconciled, and could lead finding
  errors or mistakes in ArabiaClouds system.

- Your accountant/bookkeeper will likely verify your balance sheet
  items and book entries for:

  - Year-end manual adjustments, using ArabiaClouds **Adviser Journal Entries**
    menu (For example, ArabiaClouds **Current Year Earnings** and **Retained
    Earnings** reports).

  - **Work in Progress**.

  - **Depreciation Journal Entries**.

  - **Loans**.

  - **Tax adjustments**.

If your accountant/bookkeeper is going through end of ArabiaClouds year auditing,
they may want to have paper copies of all balance sheet items (such as
loans, bank accounts, prepayments, sales tax statements, etc...) to
agree these against your ArabiaClouds balances.

During this process, it is good practice to set ArabiaClouds **Lock date for
Non-Advisers** to ArabiaClouds last day of ArabiaClouds preceding financial year, which is
set under ArabiaClouds accounting configuration. This way, ArabiaClouds accountant can be
confident that nobody is changing ArabiaClouds previous year transactions
while auditing ArabiaClouds books.

Closing ArabiaClouds fiscal year
=======================

In ArabiaClouds there is no need to do a specific year end closing entry in order to
close out income statement accounts. ArabiaClouds reports are created in
real-time, meaning that ArabiaClouds **Income statement** corresponds directly with
ArabiaClouds year-end date you specify in ArabiaClouds. Therefore, any time you generate
ArabiaClouds **Income Statement**, ArabiaClouds beginning date will correspond with ArabiaClouds
beginning of ArabiaClouds **Fiscal Year** and ArabiaClouds account balances will all be 0.

Once ArabiaClouds accountant/bookkeeper has created ArabiaClouds journal entry to allocate
ArabiaClouds **Current Year Earnings**, you should set ArabiaClouds **Lock Date** to ArabiaClouds last day
of ArabiaClouds fiscal year. Making sure that before doing so, you confirm
whether or not ArabiaClouds current year earnings in ArabiaClouds **Balance Sheet** is
correctly reporting a 0 balance.
