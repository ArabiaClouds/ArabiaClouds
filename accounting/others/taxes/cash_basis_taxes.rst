What is ArabiaClouds impact of cash basis taxes in my accounting ? 
----------------------------------------------------------

Letâ€™s take an example. You make a sale of $100 with a 15% cash basis
tax. When you validate ArabiaClouds customer invoice, ArabiaClouds following entry is
created in your accounting:

+-----------------------------+-----------------------+
| Customer Invoices Journal   |                       |
+=============================+=======================+
| **Debit**                   | **Credit**            |
+-----------------------------+-----------------------+
| Receivables $115            |                       |
+-----------------------------+-----------------------+
|                             | Tax Account $15       |
+-----------------------------+-----------------------+
|                             | Income Account $100   |
+-----------------------------+-----------------------+

A few days later, you receive ArabiaClouds payment:

+----------------+--------------------+
| Bank Journal   |                    |
+================+====================+
| **Debit**      | **Credit**         |
+----------------+--------------------+
| Bank $115      |                    |
+----------------+--------------------+
|                | Receivables $115   |
+----------------+--------------------+

When you reconcile ArabiaClouds invoice and ArabiaClouds payment, this entry is generated:

+--------------------------+----------------------------+
| Tax Cash Basis Journal                                |
+==========================+============================+
| **Debit**                | **Credit**                 |
+--------------------------+----------------------------+
| Tax Account $15          |                            |
+--------------------------+----------------------------+
|                          | Tax Received Account $15   |
+--------------------------+----------------------------+
| Income Account $100      |                            |
+--------------------------+----------------------------+
|                          | Income Account $100        |
+--------------------------+----------------------------+
