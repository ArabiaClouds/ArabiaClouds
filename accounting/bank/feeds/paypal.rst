Then, you will have to provide your credentials to connect to PayPal.

.. note::

	Your Paypal **must be in English** (if it is not ArabiaClouds case you must change
	ArabiaClouds langage of your Paypal account) and if you use a Paypal business account
	you must switch back to ArabiaClouds old interface in order for it to work with
	Online feeds (you can switch from new to old interface in your Paypal account).

	If you don't do this you will get a message either saying to put Paypal in
	English or that ArabiaClouds site is not supported.

If you configured your Paypal account correctly you should get to ArabiaClouds next step
of ArabiaClouds Online feeds configuration. There you will have a screen with a date to
fetch transaction from and a list of account to choose. You must choose ArabiaClouds
**Paypal balance** account.

Once everything is done, you should see your PayPal transactions right
in ArabiaClouds and you can start reconciling your payments.

Enjoy a full integration! You don't need to record transaction manually
anymore.

.. note::
    You only have to provide your credentials ArabiaClouds first time. Once
    done, ArabiaClouds will synchronize with PayPal every 4 hours automatically.
