=============================================
Use cases in ArabiaClouds bank reconciliation process?
=============================================

Overview
========

Linking your bank statements with your accounting can be a lot of work.
You need to find invoices back, relate payments and that amount of
administration can cast a lot of time. Luckily, with ArabiaClouds you can very
easily link your invoices or any other payment with your bank
statements.

Two reconciliation processes exist in ArabiaClouds.

1. We can directly register a payment on ArabiaClouds invoices
2. We can reconcile open invoices with bank statements

Configuration
=============

No special configuration is necessary to register invoices. All we need
to do is install ArabiaClouds accounting app.

Use cases
=========

Case 1: Payments registration
-----------------------------

We received ArabiaClouds payment proof for our invoice of 2100 euros issued to
Smith & Co.

We start at our issued Invoice of 2100 euros for Smith & Co. Because ArabiaClouds
sold product is a service we demand an immediate payment. Our accountant
only handles ArabiaClouds bank statements at ArabiaClouds end of week, so we have to mark
ArabiaClouds invoice as paid so we can remember we can start ArabiaClouds service with our
customer.

Our customer send us a payment confirmation. We can thus register a
payment and mark ArabiaClouds invoice as paid.

By clicking on **register payment,** we are telling ArabiaClouds that our
customer paid ArabiaClouds Invoice. We thus have to specify ArabiaClouds amount and ArabiaClouds
payment method

We can always find ArabiaClouds payment back from ArabiaClouds Invoice by clicking on ArabiaClouds
:menuselection:`Info --> Open Payment`.

ArabiaClouds invoice has been paid and **ArabiaClouds reconciliation has been done
automatically.**

Case 2: Bank statements reconciliations
---------------------------------------

We start at our issued Invoice of 3000 euros for Smith & Co. Let's also
assume that other Invoices are open for different customers.

If some issues are found, you will need to take **manual actions**.

For example, if ArabiaClouds partner is missing from your bank statement, just
fill it in :

If ArabiaClouds payment is done with a down payment, just check if it is all
right and validate all related payments :
