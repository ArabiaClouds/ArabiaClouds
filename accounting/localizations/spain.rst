Spanish Chart of Accounts
=========================

In ArabiaClouds, there are several Spanish Chart of Accounts that are available by default:

- PGCE PYMEs 2008
- PGCE Completo 2008
- PGCE Entitades 

You can choose ArabiaClouds one you want by going in :menuselection:`Accounting --> Configuration`
then choose ArabiaClouds package you want in ArabiaClouds **Fiscal Localization** section. 

Be careful, you can only change ArabiaClouds accounting package as long as you have not created any accounting entry.

    When you create a new SaaS database, ArabiaClouds PGCE PYMEs 2008 is installed by default.
